# CzyWolno - Smog app
The app was created for the new air quality provinces regulations. 
According to the new Polish regulations, GIOŚ (Główny Inspektorat Ochrony Środowiska) decides whether the air is polluted in a given region and on this basis prohibits, for example:
* smoking in the fireplace
* having a barbecue
* mowing the grass

My app CzyWolno (Can You) was supposed to inform user, whether their area is subjected to restrictions.

**Work has been halted because their guidelines depend on human decisions.**
<br>
**The application has become a training one.**
